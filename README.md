# Portfolio
*By Arthur Brouwers*

## Intro
Welcome to my GitHub portfolio for Semester 3 projects! As a dedicated learner and aspiring developer, I have created this portfolio to showcase my skills, experiences, and accomplishments in various projects undertaken during my studies.

Throughout Semester 3, I have been working on diverse projects covering different programming languages, tools, and technologies. This portfolio contains a collection of these projects, which not only highlight my technical skills but also demonstrate my problem-solving abilities and creativity.

In this portfolio, you will find a range of projects including web development and software development. Each project is accompanied by a brief description, its purpose, and the technologies used. You can explore the code, read the documentation, and see the outcomes of each project.

Overall, this portfolio represents my passion for learning, developing, and sharing my knowledge with others. I hope you find it informative and engaging, and it inspires you to collaborate or learn from me.

This semester, I collaborated with [Matthijs Dolmans](https://github.com/MatthijsDolmans/MatthijsDolmansS3) on the individual project.

        <p>
          In my individual project, I have proficiently designed and built a user-friendly, full-stack web application.
        </p>
        <p>
          For user-friendliness, I applied basic user experience testing, resulting in intuitive and visually appealing interfaces. Using the Vue3 framework, I created dynamic and interactive front-end components that enhance the user experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          In terms of the full-stack, I selected Java as the back-end language for efficient data retrieval from a MySQL database. By utilizing the JPA (Java Persistence API) ORM framework, I ensured smooth data persistence and seamless communication between the front-end and back-end. Thorough research was conducted to make informed language and framework choices.
        </p>
        <p>
          Evidence of my proficiency can be found in the project repositories: <a href="https://github.com/ArthurBrouwersSemester3/Front-end">front-end</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ArthurBrouwersSemester3/API">back-end</a>. Additionally, the <a href="https://github.com/ArthurBrouwersSemester3/Documentation/blob/main/ResearchDocuments.md">research back-end/front-end</a> document showcases my ability to make informed decisions based on thorough research.
        </p>
        <p>
          Overall, my project demonstrates proficiency in designing and building user-friendly, full-stack web applications through effective UI/UX practices, the use of Vue3 for the front-end, and Java with JPA for the back-end, ensuring seamless communication and data persistence.

        </p>
        <p>
          In our group project, we exhibited proficiency in selecting and implementing an agile software development method. We began each day with a stand-up meeting to discuss the tasks planned for the day. After a lunch break, we reconvened to provide updates on completed tasks or raise any issues that required assistance. Additionally, after each sprint, we conducted retrospectives to reflect on the progress and plan the next sprint. For our project management, we utilized Jira to facilitate sprint planning and backlog management. These practices demonstrate our proficiency in implementing agile principles within the group project. Evidence of our proficiency can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/wocevv/Documentation/blob/main/Sprint/AllSprints.md">group project retrospective</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, in my individual project, I continued to employ agile principles such as stand-ups, sprint planning, and retrospectives. By maintaining consistency in applying these agile practices, I demonstrated proficiency in effectively managing and executing my individual project. The <a href="https://github.com/ArthurBrouwersSemester3/Documentation/blob/main/Sprint%20planning%20-%20retrospective.md">individual project retrospective</a> provides additional evidence of my proficiency in implementing agile methodologies.
        </p>
        <p>
          Overall, our group project and individual project exemplify proficiency in choosing and implementing suitable agile software development methods. By utilizing practices such as stand-ups, sprint planning, and retrospectives, we effectively embraced agile principles and ensured smooth project management. The use of tools like Jira further emphasizes our proficiency in employing suitable software for agile project management.
