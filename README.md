# Portfolio
*By Arthur Brouwers*

## Intro
Welcome to my GitHub portfolio for Semester 3 projects! As a dedicated learner and aspiring developer, I have created this portfolio to showcase my skills, experiences, and accomplishments in various projects undertaken during my studies.

Throughout Semester 3, I have been working on diverse projects covering different programming languages, tools, and technologies. This portfolio contains a collection of these projects, which not only highlight my technical skills but also demonstrate my problem-solving abilities and creativity.

In this portfolio, you will find a range of projects including web development and software development. Each project is accompanied by a brief description, its purpose, and the technologies used. You can explore the code, read the documentation, and see the outcomes of each project.

Overall, this portfolio represents my passion for learning, developing, and sharing my knowledge with others. I hope you find it informative and engaging, and it inspires you to collaborate or learn from me.

This semester, I collaborated with [Matthijs Dolmans](https://github.com/MatthijsDolmans/MatthijsDolmansS3) on the individual project.
